                <i>Gimbap also romanized as kimbap, is a Korean dish made from cooked rice and ingredients such as vegetables, 
                fish, and meats that are rolled in gim, dried sheets of seaweedâ€”and served in bite-sized slices. The 
                origins of gimbap are debated. Some sources suggest it originates from Japanese norimaki, introduced during
                Japanese colonial rule, while others argue it is a modernized version of bokssam from the Joseon era. Regardless,
                it has since become a distinct dish. The dish is often part of a packed meal, or dosirak, to be eaten at 
                picnics and outdoor events, and can serve as a light lunch along with danmuji (yellow pickled radish) and kimchi.
                It is a popular take-out food in South Korea and abroad and is known as a convenient food because of its portability.

                <i>Korean noodles are noodles or noodle dishes in Korean cuisine, and are collectively referred to as "guksu"
                in native Korean or "myeon" in hanja character. Preparations with noodles are relatively simple and dates 
                back to around BC 6000 to BC 5000 in Asia. In Korea, traditional noodle dishes are onmyeon (beef broth-based
                noodle soup), called guksu jangguk (noodles with a hot clear broth), naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles), 
                bibim guksu (cold noodle dish mixed with vegetables), kalguksu (knife-cut noodles), kongguksu (noodles with a 
                cold soybean broth) among others. In royal court, baekmyeon (literally "white noodles") consisting of buckwheat
                noodles and pheasant broth, was regarded as the top quality noodle dish. Naengmyeon, with a cold soup mixed with
                dongchimi (watery radish kimchi) and beef brisk broth, was eaten in court during summer.

                <i>Tteokbokki, or simmered rice cake, is a popular Korean food made from small-sized garae-tteok 
                (long, white, cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon (rice cake noodles) or commonly 
                tteokbokki-tteok (tteokbokki rice cakes). Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and scallions are some
                common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in dishes. It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang
                (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based sauce; the former is the most common form, while 
                the latter is less common and sometimes called gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki).</i>
