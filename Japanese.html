                A bento is the Japanese iteration of a single-portion take-out or home-packed meal, often for lunch. 
                The term bento is derived from the Chinese term biandang which means "convenient" or "convenience".A traditional 
                bento may contain rice or noodles with fish or meat, often with pickled and cooked vegetables in a box. Containers 
                range from mass-produced disposables to hand-crafted lacquerware. Often various dividers are used to separate
                ingredients or dishes, especially those with strong flavors, to avoid them affecting the taste of the rest of the meal.
                A typical divider is green plastic grass, also known as the 'sushi grass'. This also works to slow the growth of bacteria.

                Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a broth; common 
                flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced pork (chāshū), nori (dried seaweed),
                menma (bamboo shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes.Nearly every region 
                in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the 
                miso ramen of Hokkaido.

                Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a 
                variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation 
                vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice". The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya 
                Yohei,who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed 
                vinegared rice, around 1824. Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice. It is very often 
                prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of
                sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish 
                or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

                Tempura is a typical Japanese dish usually consisting of seafood, meat and vegetables that have been battered
                and deep fried. The dish was introduced by the Portuguese in Nagasaki through fritter-cooking techniques in 
                the 16th century. The word tempura comes from the Latin word tempora, a term referring to times of fasting when
                the church dictated that Catholics go meatless
